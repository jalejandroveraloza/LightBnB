# LightBnb

A simple multi-page Airbnb clone that uses a server-side Javascript to display the information from queries to web pages via SQL queries.

The focus of this project was SQL queries, this project includes a basic front end and back end, that allows users to login/signup, look at previous reservations ranked by rating, send data to the server for owners who want to list their property.

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.
